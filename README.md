# 🍺 Beer Styles Wiki – Frontend

A user-friendly React application that consumes the [Beer Styles Wiki API](https://github.com/your-username/beer-styles-wiki-api). It allows users to browse BJCP-style beer data, search by category, and interact through comments and a fun quiz to test their knowledge.

> I made this as a **CRUD exercise** — the adding and deleting of comments are accessible by anyone.
